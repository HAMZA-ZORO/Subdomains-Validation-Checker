**There is a LOT of tools that used in information gathering that gives you subdomains that usually most of them is not working or 
giving 404 (not found) ,403 (forbidden), etc... 
 So, this code takes a text file name that have the subdomains and check for their validation,
 
 it will store in a new text files all the valid subdomains that make a:
     1.response status code 200 in a file.
     2.403 in another file as they might be usefull. **
